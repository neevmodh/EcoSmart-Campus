# EcoSmart-Campus
Optimize Campus Energy Consumption with Mathematical Intelligence Our advanced system uses Discrete Mathematics models to predict, monitor, and optimize electricity usage across your campus, reducing costs and environmental impact.

Each mathematical model (probability, recurrence, Boolean logic, graph theory) is mapped to its own interactive tool for modular scalability.

## 🧠 Mathematical Engine

1. **Energy Function:**  
   `f(r,t)` → Real-time energy consumption of room *r* at time *t*  

2. **Savings Recurrence:**  
   `S_n = E_{n-1} - E_n` → Day-over-day energy improvement  

3. **Occupancy Probability:**  
   `P_r(t) = Hours Occupied / Total Hours`  

4. **Graph Optimization:**  
   MST via Prim’s / Kruskal’s  
   Dominating Set → Optimal sensor placement  

5. **Automation Logic:**  
   `L_r(t) = O_r(t) ∧ C_r(t)` → Combined room and condition rule
